# I present my skills as a front-end developer in this project and show my process for building this portfolio. Here, I'm going to explain my strategy, the difficulties I came across while developing the project, how I overcame them, and the important lessons I gathered up along the way.

# Development - To create my portfolio, I applied HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I started by building a responsive layout from the ground up using Bootstrap. I created my own CSS to add more adjustability and design. I organized my portfolio into sections, including the home page, my portfolio, and my contact information. I made sure that each part flow together and looked good.

# I adjusted every image and design used in my professional portfolio to increase performance. I utilized a variety of image sizes and the <picture> tag with the "srcset" and "sizes" attributes to provide images that has been suitably sized for various screen sizes.

# Making a fully responsive layout represented one of the biggest difficulties I faced. Careful preparation and testing have been necessary to ensure sure that my portfolio showed perfect on a variety of screens, from the size desktop displays to small mobile devices. I overcame this difficulty by using media queries and Bootstrap's adaptable grid technology to change the layout to fit different screen sizes.

# I struggled into a lot of problems and problems when developing the application. I came to the realization that a web developer must have the ability to solve problems. I discovered how to simplify difficult issues into smaller, more manageable tasks and how to effectively find and resolve problems using debugging resources.
